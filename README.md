# Taiwanses-Food-101
In this project, we propose how to create Taiwanese-Food-101 Dataset, how to use Deep Learning to train the model, and compare the accuracy of each famous model.
## Dataset
We download the image from Google and Instagram to create Taiwanese-Food-101 Dataset. <br>
The details of how we use Google and Instagram create Taiwanese-Food-101 Dataset method is in **Download-image-code.txt**.
## Training model
We use different famous convolutional neural network model on Keras. <br>
The details of how we train the model is in **Tawanese-Food-101.ipynb**. <br>
We also evaluate each model by Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy.
Age           | Time  | Food | Gold | Requirement
------------  | ----  | ---  | ---  | ---
Feudal Age    | 02:10 |  500 |    0 | Dark Age building x 2
Castle Age    | 02:40 |  800 |  200 | Feudal Age building x 2
Imperial Age  | 03:30 | 1000 |  800 | Castle Age building x
